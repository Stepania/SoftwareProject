        <p>employment opportunities in this fast-evolving field.
            Our IT industry partners have significant input into the structure and content of this programme to ensure that what is being taught continually meets industry needs.
            
            The first year covers a broad range of ICT topics that will provide you with a solid base of knowledge in software engineering (programming), hardware and networking, website development, IT tools and concepts and mathematics skills relevant to IT.
            
            In years two and three you'll choose one of three specialist pathways: Information Systems, Networking and Infrastructure or Software Development. During this time you'll develop in-depth knowledge of your chosen area through a range of compulsory and elective courses.
            
            You'll also develop skills in problem solving, critical thinking, analysis, team work, project management, time management, self-reliance and communication skills. There is a strong emphasis on practical skills and work-readiness, so wherever possible, theory is integrated and applied to practical tasks.
            
            Many courses include group activities or group projects, as the ability to work as part of a team is strongly valued by employers.
            
            In the final semester you'll put all of your acquired skills and knowledge into practice in a 45-credit capstone project (in most cases for a local business). The project is an excellent opportunity to equip yourself with real-world IT experience and to learn from industry people. It also results in a substantial piece of work with which to demonstrate your potential to prospective employers. Part-time up to 5 years.
            
            This leads to the Bachelor of Information and Communication Technologies</p>
